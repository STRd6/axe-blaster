Gameplay

Creatures and Monsters
----------------------

It's boring jumping around with no obstacles or objectives. Having some weird
monster would spice things up.

[ ] Bat
[ ] Ninji (SMB2)

Items
-----

Not entirely sure what direction to take things, but exploring some combat stuff
could be neat.

[ ] Sword
[ ] Shield
[ ] Bow and Arrow
[ ] Spear
[ ] Flintlock
[ ] Grenade
[ ] Six shooter

May want to focus on stealth and tactics.

Could also go a more CaveStory route and remove focus on melee and instead have
a more run and gun feel.
